Header photos from "pexels.com"

I ceated my site using css grid,flexbox and some Js plugins. I wanted the  site to have
a clean look to it and make my photography be the focus. I origionally went with a darker them but I felt like it 
was hard to read at times.

A challenge I had was the photo gallery
 I felt like like I was never satisfied with the way it looked so i ended up making a basic 
 grid design that is easy to look through at all screen types.

 I learned how to use the nth child elements before hand I never really got how they worked.
